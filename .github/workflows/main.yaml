# Security note: This workflow uses pull_request_target which runs with repository permissions.
# We've implemented security measures to handle PRs from forks safely:
# 1. Explicit permission declarations
# 2. Conditional steps based on PR source (fork vs. non-fork)
# 3. Limited operations for fork PRs
# 4. Careful handling of checkout with explicit ref
