```

To view the generated coverage report you can use [lcov](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov).

# Generate Coverage Report
$ genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/

# Open Coverage Report
$ open coverage/index.html
```

## Contributing ü§ù

Contributions, issues, and feature requests are welcome! See the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file for guidelines.

## Code Formatting üìù

This project uses `dart format` with a line length of 80 characters. To ensure your code is properly formatted before committing, you can:

### Option 1: Use the Pre-commit Hook (Recommended)

Set up the pre-commit hook to automatically format your code before each commit:

```sh
# Configure Git to use the hooks in the .githooks directory
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
chmod +x .githooks/pre-commit
```

### Option 2: Format Manually

Run the formatter manually before committing:

```sh
dart format --line-length 80 lib test
```

Proper formatting is enforced in the CI pipeline, but the pipeline will not fail if formatting issues are detected. Instead, it will display a warning message.
