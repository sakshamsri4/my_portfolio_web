    - Liskov Substitution: Used test helpers that properly substitute real implementations
    - Interface Segregation: Created minimal interfaces for test mocks
    - Dependency Inversion: Used dependency injection for controllers in tests

  - **DRY Principles Application**:
    - Created reusable test widget builders to avoid code duplication
    - Extracted common test setup logic into helper methods
    - Used shared mock implementations across multiple test files
    - Created utility functions for common test operations

  - **CRED Design Principles in Testing**:
    - Clarity: Made test assertions clear and focused on what's being tested
    - Reliability: Ensured tests are not brittle and don't fail due to unrelated changes
    - Efficiency: Optimized tests to run quickly and not waste resources
    - Durability: Made tests resilient to UI changes and implementation details

  - **Best Practices for Flutter Testing**:
    - Always set explicit screen sizes for widget tests to avoid overflow issues
    - Use proper teardown to clean up resources and reset state
    - Don't test implementation details, test behavior and functionality
    - Handle asynchronous operations properly with pump() and pumpAndSettle()
    - Mock external dependencies to isolate the component being tested
    - Use testWidgets for UI components and test for unit tests
    - Prefer finding widgets by type or key rather than by text when possible
    - Always add proper theme data to test widgets to avoid null theme errors
